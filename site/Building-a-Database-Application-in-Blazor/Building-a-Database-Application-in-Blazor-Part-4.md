# Building a Database Application in Blazor 
## Part 4 - UI Components

::: danger
This article as others in this series is a building site.  Total revamp.  See CodeProject for the most recent released version which is very out-of-date

## Introduction

This article is the fourth in a series on Building Blazor Database Applications.  This article looks at the components we use in the UI and then focuses on how to build generic UI Components from HTML and CSS.
.

This is the fourth article in the series looking at how to build and structure a real Database Application in Blazor. The articles so far are:

1. Project Structure and Framework.
2. Services - Building the CRUD Data Layers.
3. View Components - CRUD Edit and View Operations in the UI.
4. UI Components - Building HTML/CSS Controls.
5. View Components - CRUD List Operations in the UI.
6. A walk through detailing how to add weather stations and weather station data to the application.

## Repository and Database

The repository for the articles has move to [CEC.Blazor.SPA Repository](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.SPA).  [CEC.Blazor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor) is obselete and will be removed.

There's a SQL script in /SQL in the repository for building the database.

[You can see the Server and WASM versions of the project running here on the same site](https://cec-blazor-server.azurewebsites.net/).

Serveral classes described here are part of the separate *CEC.Blazor.Core* library.  The Github is [here](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor.Core), and is available as a Nuget Package.

### Components

For a detailed look at components read my article [A Dive into Blazor Components](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5277618/A-Dive-into-Blazor-Components).

Everything in the Blazor UI, other than the start page, is a component.  Yes App, Router,... they're all components.  Components don't need to emit Html.

You can divide components into four categories:
1. RouteViews - these are the top level components.  Views are combined with a Layout to make the display window.
2. Layouts - Layouts combine with Views to make up the display window.
3. Forms - Forms are logical collections of controls.  Edit forms, display forms, list forms, data entry wizards are all classic forms.  Forms contain controls - not HTML.
4. Controls - Controls either display something - emit HTML - or do some unit of work.  Text boxes, dropdowns, buttons, grids are all classic Hrtml emitting controls. App, Router, Validation are controls that do units of work.

### RouteViews

RouteViews are application specific, the only difference between a RouteView and a Form is a RouteView declares one or more routes through the `@Page` directive.  The `Router` component declared in the root `App` sets the `AppAssembly` to a secific code assembly.  This is the assembly that `Router` trawls though on startup to find all the declared routes.

In the application we declare RouteViews in both the WASM application and Server library. 

The Weather Forecast Viewer and List Views are shown below.

```csharp
// Blazor.Database.Server/RouteViews/Weather/WeatherViewer.cs
@page "/weather/view/{ID:int}"

<WeatherForecastViewerForm ID="this.ID" ExitAction="this.ExitToList"></WeatherForecastViewerForm>

@code {
    [Parameter] public int ID { get; set; }

    [Inject] public NavigationManager NavManager { get; set; }

    private void ExitToList()
        => this.NavManager.NavigateTo("/fetchdata");
}
```


```csharp
// Blazor.Database.Server/RouteViews/Weather/FetchData.cs
@page "/fetchdata"

<WeatherForecastComponent></WeatherForecastComponent>
```

### Forms

We saw Forms in the last article.  They are specific to the application, but are common across WASM and Server projects, and in the solution are in */Components/Forms*  in the *Blazor.Database* library.

The code below shows the Weather Viewer.  It's all UI Controls, no HTML markup.

```html
// Blazor.Database/Components/Forms/WeatherForecastViewerForm.razor
@namespace Blazor.Database.Components
@inherits RecordFormBase<WeatherForecast>

<UIContainer>
    <UIFormRow>
        <UIColumn>
            <h2>Weather Forecast Viewer</h2>
        </UIColumn>
    </UIFormRow>
</UIContainer>
<UILoader Loaded="this.IsLoaded">
    <UIContainer>
        <UIFormRow>
            <UILabelColumn>
                Date
            </UILabelColumn>
            <UIInputColumn Cols="3">
                <InputReadOnlyText Value="@this.ControllerService.Record.Date.ToShortDateString()"></InputReadOnlyText>
            </UIInputColumn>
            <UIColumn Cols="7"></UIColumn>
        </UIFormRow>
        <UIFormRow>
            <UILabelColumn>
                Temperature &deg;C
            </UILabelColumn>
            <UIInputColumn Cols="2">
                <InputReadOnlyText Value="@this.ControllerService.Record.TemperatureC.ToString()"></InputReadOnlyText>
            </UIInputColumn>
            <UIColumn Cols="8"></UIColumn>
        </UIFormRow>
        <UIFormRow>
            <UILabelColumn>
                Temperature &deg;f
            </UILabelColumn>
            <UIInputColumn Cols="2">
                <InputReadOnlyText Value="@this.ControllerService.Record.TemperatureF.ToString()"></InputReadOnlyText>
            </UIInputColumn>
            <UIColumn Cols="8"></UIColumn>
        </UIFormRow>
        <UIFormRow>
            <UILabelColumn>
                Summary
            </UILabelColumn>
            <UIInputColumn Cols="9">
                <InputReadOnlyText Value="@this.ControllerService.Record.Summary"></InputReadOnlyText>
            </UIInputColumn>
        </UIFormRow>
    </UIContainer>
</UILoader>
<UIContainer>
    <UIFormRow>
        <UIButtonColumn>
            <UIButton AdditionalClasses="btn-secondary" ClickEvent="this.Exit">Exit</UIButton>
        </UIButtonColumn>
    </UIFormRow>
</UIContainer>
```

The code behind page is relatively simple - the complexity is in the boilerplate code in the parent classes.  It loads the record specific Controller service.

```csharp
// CEC.Weather/Components/Forms/WeatherForecastViewerForm.razor.cs
public partial class WeatherForecastViewerForm : RecordFormBase<WeatherForecast>
{

    [Inject] private WeatherForecastControllerService ControllerService { get; set; }

    protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        this.Service = this.ControllerService;
        await base.OnInitializedAsync();
    }
}
```

## UI Controls

UI Controls emit HTML and CSS markup.  All the controls here are based on the Bootstrap CSS Framework.  All controls inherit from `ComponentBase` and UI Controls inherit from `UIBase`.

##### UIBase

`UIBase` inherits from `Component`.  It builds an HTML DIV block that you can turn on or off.

Lets look at some of the bits of `UIBase` in detail.

The HTML block tag can be set using the `Tag` parameter.  It can only be set by inherited classes.

```csharp
protected virtual string HtmlTag => "div";
```

The control Css is built using a `CssBuilder` class.  Inheriting classes can set a primary Css value and add as many secondary values they wish.  Add on CSS classes can be added either through the `AdditionalClasses` parameter or throigh defining a `class` attribute.

```csharp
[Parameter] public virtual string AdditionalClasses { get; set; } = string.Empty;
protected virtual string PrimaryClass => string.Empty;
protected List<string> SecondaryClass { get; private set; } = new List<string>();

protected string CssClass
=> CSSBuilder.Class(this.PrimaryClass)
    .AddClass(SecondaryClass)
    .AddClass(AdditionalClasses)
    .AddClassFromAttributes(this.UserAttributes)
    .Build();
```

The control can be hidden or disabled with two parameters.  `Show` controls what's diplayed.  When `Show` is true `ChildContent` is displayed.  When `Show` is false `HideContent` is dislpayed if it isn't `null`.

```csharp
[Parameter] public bool Show { get; set; } = true;
[Parameter] public bool Disabled { get; set; } = false;
[Parameter] public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }
[Parameter] public RenderFragment HideContent { get; set; }
```


Finally the control captures and additional attributes and adds them to the markup element.

```csharp
[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)] public IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> UserAttributes { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, object>();
```

The control builds the `RenderTree` in code.

```csharp
protected override void BuildRenderTree(RenderTreeBuilder builder)
{
    if (this.Show)
    {
        builder.OpenElement(0, this.HtmlTag);
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.CssClass)) builder.AddAttribute(1, "class", this.CssClass);
        if (Disabled) builder.AddAttribute(2, "disabled");
        builder.AddMultipleAttributes(3, this.UserAttributes);
        if (this.ChildContent != null) builder.AddContent(4, ChildContent);
        else if (this.HideContent != null) builder.AddContent(5, HideContent);
        builder.CloseElement();
    }
}
```

### Some Examples

The rest of the article looks at a few of the UI controls in more detail.

##### UIButton

This is a standard Bootstrap Button. 
1. `Type` sets the button type.
2. `PrimaryClass` is set.
3. `ButtonClick` handles the button click event and calls the EventCallback.
5. `Show` and `Disabled` handle button state.

```csharp
// Blazor.SPA/Components/UIComponents/Base/UIButtons.cs
@namespace Blazor.SPA.Components
@inherits UIBase
@if (this.Show)
{
    <button class="@this.CssClass" @onclick="ButtonClick" type="@Type" disabled="@this.Disabled" @attributes="UserAttributes">
        @this.ChildContent
    </button>
}
@code {
    [Parameter] public string Type { get; set; } = "button";
    [Parameter] public EventCallback<MouseEventArgs> ClickEvent { get; set; }
    protected override string PrimaryClass => "btn mr-1";
    protected async Task ButtonClick(MouseEventArgs e) => await this.ClickEvent.InvokeAsync(e);
}
```

Here's some code showing the control in use.

```html
<UIButton Show="true" Disabled="this._dirtyExit" AdditionalClasses="btn-dark" ClickEvent="() => this.Exit()">Exit</UIButton>
```

##### UIColumn

This is a standard Bootstrap Column. 
1. `Cols` defines the number of columns
2. `PrimaryCss` is built from`Cols`.
3. `Base` `RenderTreeBuilder` builds out the control as a *div*. 

```csharp
// Blazor.SPA/Components/UIControls/Base/UIColumn.cs
public class UIColumn : UIBase
{
    [Parameter] public virtual int Cols { get; set; } = 0;
    protected override string PrimaryClass => this.Cols > 0 ? $"col-{this.Cols}" : $"col";
}
```

##### UILoader

This is a wrapper control designed to save implementing error checking in child content. It only renders it's child content when `IsLoaded` is true. The control saves implementing a lot of error checking in the child content.

```csharp
@namespace Blazor.SPA.Components
@inherits UIBase

@if (this.Loaded)
{
    @this.ChildContent
}
else
{
    <div>Loading....</div>
}

@code {
    [Parameter] public bool Loaded { get; set; }
}
```

You can see the control in use in the Edit and View forms.

##### UIContainer/UIRow/UIColumn

These controls create the BootStrap grid system - i.e. container, row and column - by building out DIVs with the correct Css.

```csharp
public class UIContainer : UIBase
{
    protected override string PrimaryClass => "container-fluid";
}
```

```csharp
class UIRow : UIBase
{
    protected override string PrimaryClass => "row";
}
```

```csharp
public class UIColumn : UIBase
{
    [Parameter] public virtual int Cols { get; set; } = 0;
    protected override string PrimaryClass => this.Cols > 0 ? $"col-{this.Cols}" : $"col";
}
```

```csharp
// CEC.Blazor/Components/UIControls/UIBootstrapContainer/UILabelColumn.cs
public class UILabelColumn : UIColumn
{
    protected override string _BaseCss => $"col-{Columns} col-form-label";
}
```

Here's some code showing the controls in use.

```html
<UIContainer>
    <UIRow>
        <UILabelColumn Columns="2">
            Date
        </UILabelColumn>
        ............
    </UIRow>
..........
</UIContainer>
```

### Wrap Up
This article provides an overview on how to build UI Controls with components, and examines some example components in more detail.  You can see all the library UIControls in the GitHub Repository

Some key points to note:
1. UI Controls let you abstract markup from higher level components such as Forms and Views.
2. UI Controls give you control and applies some discipline over the HTML and CSS markup.
3. View and Form components are much cleaner and easier to view.
4. Use as little or as much abstraction as you wish.
5. Controls, such as `UILoader`, make life easier!
