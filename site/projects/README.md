# This Week's Pets

Grrrr!!!  Still in lockdown here in the UK.  No travelling, should be in the Alps by now: just boring old coding.

New Article - 

## Getting my Personal Site up and running on Github

Work in progress - I've settled on using VuePress after a lot of experimenting.  Currently working on the coding side, but the travel side will cowe along.

## Revamp Building a Database Application in Blazor

Yet another iteration at this.

## Editor Forms in Blazor

Latest article to publish this week - the `InlineDialog`.
